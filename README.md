## 🐦‍🔥 Milestones

### 🏁 Phase 1: Config Based Approach

> **The Launch Pad**  
> Our journey kicks off with the ultimate configuration wizardry! Here, the entire universe revolves around configs. No templates, no fuss—just pure, unadulterated config power. Set your parameters, tweak your settings, and let the magic happen. The stage is set; are you?

### 🧩 Phase 2: Add More Templates - Templates + Config Approach

> **Mix & Match, Baby!**  
> Say goodbye to basic! In Phase 2, we supercharge our system with a massive infusion of **Templates**! 🧙‍♂️ Now, it’s not just about the configs; it’s about building with style. Pick a template, drop in some configs, and watch your ideas burst to life like fireworks on the Fourth of July. Templates + Config = Creative Mayhem! 💥

### 🛠 Phase 3: App Builder

> **Building Blocks Unleashed**  
> Ready to build apps without breaking a sweat? Our App Builder arrives with a vengeance! Drag, drop, and dominate with an intuitive interface that turns app creation into child’s play. Whether you're a coding wizard or a first-timer, this builder has you covered. The playground is open—build to your heart's content! 🏗️

### 🤖 Phase 4: Automated AI Builder Interface Based on Templates

> **Let the AI Take Over**  
> It’s time to level up. Enter the AI Builder, an automated interface that takes templates, sprinkles in some AI magic, and spits out pure genius. Just point, click, and watch your vision morph into a living, breathing application—no coding required. This is where automation meets imagination! 🧠✨

### 🤯 Phase 5: Fully Automated AI Builder

> **The Singularity of App Creation**  
> The endgame. The final frontier. The Fully Automated AI Builder doesn’t just build apps—it dreams them into existence. Feed it your thoughts, your inspirations, and watch as it crafts fully functional masterpieces at the speed of light. The future of app development is here, and it's completely hands-free. This is where the machine takes over... in the best way possible. 🚀🤖
